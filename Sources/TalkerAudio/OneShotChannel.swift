    // state (`value` and `suspension`) across the calls to
    // `withUnsafeContinuation`. Unfortunately, this method introduces a
    // suspension point. So we need a lock. But the Swift compiler is never out
    // of funny jokes:
    //
    // > Instance method 'lock' is unavailable from asynchronous contexts;
    // > Use async-safe scoped locking instead; this is an error in Swift 6
    //
    // This is very immature, because we don't quite have any other solution.
    // Maybe the authors of Swift concurrency will find it interesting
    // eventually to provide 1. building blocks that 2. solve known problems
    // and 3. back deploy. So far they're busy polishing something else.
    //
    // So let's just hide the lock and mute this stupid warning:
